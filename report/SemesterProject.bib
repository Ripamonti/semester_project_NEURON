abstract = {This article concludes a series of papers concerned with the flow of electric current through the surface membrane of a giant nerve fibre (Hodgkin, Huxley {\&} Katz, 1952; Hodgkin {\&} Huxley, 1952 a-c). Its general object is to discu the results of the preceding papers (Part I), to put them into mathematical form (Part II) and to show that they will account for conduction and excitation in quantitative terms (Part III).},

@misc{Hairer_2,
abstract = {This book deals with methods for solving nonstiff ordinary differential equations. The first chapter describes the historical development of the classical theory from Newton, Leibniz, Euler, and Hamilton to limit cycles and strange attractors. In a second chapter a modern treatment of Runge-Kutta and extrapolation methods is given. Also included are continuous methods for dense output, parallel Runge-Kutta methods, special methods for Hamiltonian systems, second order differential equations and delay equations. The third chapter begins with the classical theory of multistep methods, and concludes with the theory of general linear methods. Many applications from physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy together with computer programs and numerical comparisons are presented. This new edition has been rewritten, errors have been eliminated and new material has been included. The book will be immensely useful to graduate students and researchers in numerical analysis and scientific computing, and to scientists in the fields mentioned above.},

The same effects (on a different scale) occur with more sophisticated higher-order$\backslash$n integration schemes. The experiments presented here should serve as a motivation for the theoretical and practical investigations$\backslash$n of later chapters. The reader is encouraged to repeat the experiments or to invent similar ones.},

For this method error bounds are derived which are valid under rather general conditions. In order to make sure that the error remains bounded as t → ∞, even though the product of the Lipschitz constant and the step-size is quite large, one needs not to assume much more than that the integral curve is uniformly asymptotically stable in the sense of Liapunov.},
